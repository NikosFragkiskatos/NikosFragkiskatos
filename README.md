- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikosFragkiskatos
- 👀 I’m interested in practical subjects, like IIoT/MES Software Development, Data Engineering, and Generative AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently constructing an complete MES system using the Ignition (v8.1) platform, with goal to build a custom MCP tool that will be able to answer MES/IIoT related questions (short-term goal), and eventually be able to make code edits/upgrades/cleanups (long-term goal). The main "players" are a custom python-based PLC-Simulator, UNS via MQTT, Ignition for Frontend and MES-logic, and DB's supporting those three players.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the aforementioned subjects.
